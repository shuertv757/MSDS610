This doesn't necessarily mean there is a bias here, but one consideration is the format of the questionair. All of the questions are in english, and the survey is a google form survey. These two details already narrow the field to people most likely to answer the form to be Americans and people who are fluent with technology. Looking at the second question answers, we can see that 'Computing or Tech' is the number one response with almost double the amount of entries as the second most counted response, 'Higher Education'. \n",

    "\n",
    "The only mandatory question that doesn't have all 28108 is question 3, where someone got away with leaving their job title empty. The rest of the questions that have missing entries are not required to be filled out in the survey, so for one reason or another the users have left those questions blank. No matter the reason, I don't think it would be fair to try and predict what any of the non-mandatory answers could be as the users left them blank for a reason. If we wanted to go and fill in any blanks, the questions should have been mandatory and had a 'Prefer not to answer' and 'N/A' options, so that there would be as many entries as possible and shows that the information is important to the survey.\n",

    "The only exception to this I see if for question 6, we can fill the Nan values with a 0. I think the wording of the question, or lack thereof, can lead people who don't make any sort of bonus to leave the field blank rather than putting in a 0. "

    "Write a short reflection (400-500 words) answering the following: \n",
    "- What were the biggest issues you encountered in the messy dataset?\n",
    "- How did cleaning the dataset improve its usability for machine learning?\n",

    "I'm not sure if the purpose of this assignment was to jump through a bunch of technical hoops trying to figure out different ways to manipulate the data but based on my assesment of the data, I don't believe all of that is neccessary. Without having very specific questions to answer, it is hard to tell what data is going to be useful or not. Im not entirly sure how long it takes for a ML system to read through empty cells, but having removed 3/18 columns, removing 84324 cells, I would assume that provides some level of increased efficiency for future analysis. Considering I did not feel the need to remove any single entries, I don't believe any of the numbers would change if analysis was done on the cleaned vs the uncleaned version. After changing the NaN values in q6 to 0, any analysis done using that information would be a lot lower assuming the NaN values would have been ignored previously. \n",
    "\n",
    "I don't believe I have caused any notable bias. When removing question 8, I removed a lot of currencies, so those countries and people that use those currencies are all represented under \"other\" which does bias the overall representation of the population, but as noted above, less than 1% of entries had filled out question 8, and some of the entries were repeats of question 7. With quesion 4, any additional context doesn't change the option they picked for question 3. Question 3 has an option to fill out a profession with the 'other' option, where any main information should be provided. Any additional context could be useful if a majority or at least over half of the entires had context, then we could search for keywords and phrases to possibly identify similarities and differences between users, however about 1/4th of the entries provided additional context. With such a small portion providing additional details, we would just be creating another subset of users, catagoriziong those that did answer question 4 seperatly from the rest of the dataset, creating our own bias. Same goes for question 9, not enough people answered question 9 to justify using the information provided. About 1/8th of entries had question 9 completed, so any analysis on question 9 would only be applicable to a subset of the data, creating a bias to those entries using any finding from data using question 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall I think if I was provided the reason for the survey or what research was to be done on the dataset, more questions could be ignored or certain entries could be catagorized or flagged. Given a lack of context to the survey and data, aside from collecting the info simply to have the information, it is difficult to make any judgements on what information should be \"cleaned\" or altered for clarity and efficiency. All of the edits I have made have been made because they are details that could bias any findings, and provide very little information and insight if left alone."
